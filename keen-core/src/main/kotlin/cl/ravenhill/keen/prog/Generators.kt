/**
 * Generates a `Program<T>` instance using one of several provided generation methods. This function is part of the
 * experimental features in the Keen library and allows for flexible program tree creation by choosing randomly from
 * multiple generation strategies.
 *
 * ## Constraints:
 * - Validates that the list of generation methods is not empty to ensure that a generation method is available for
 *   selection.
 *
 * ## Usage:
 * This method is particularly useful in scenarios where varying strategies for program generation are desirable, such
 * as in genetic programming or when experimenting with different tree generation techniques.
 *
 * ### Example:
 * ```
 * val generationMethods: List<GenerationMethod<MyValueType>> = listOf(
 *     ::generateProgramFull,
 *     ::generateProgramGrowing
 * )
 * val program = generateProgramWith(
 *     methods = generationMethods,

 * )
 * // program is a randomly generated Program<MyValueType> instance using one of the specified generation methods
 * ```
 *
 * @param methods A list of `GenerationMethod<T>` instances to choose from for program generation.
 * @param terminals A list of `Terminal<T>` nodes to be used in the program tree.
 * @param functions A list of `Fun<T>` nodes to be used as intermediate nodes in the program tree.
 * @param min The minimum height of the program tree to be generated.
 * @param max The maximum height of the program tree to be generated.
 * @param T The type of the values processed by the program nodes.
 * @return A `Program<T>` instance generated using one of the provided methods.

/**
 * Generates a [Program] structure with a growing tree configuration within specified height constraints, using terminal
 * and function nodes. This function extends the [generateProgram] function, focusing on creating growing program trees.
 * It is marked as experimental in the Keen library.
 *
 * ## Functionality:
 * - Generates a [Program] tree where the decision to create terminal or function nodes is probabilistically based on
 *   their relative sizes in the provided lists.
 * - Utilizes the [generateProgram] method, providing it with a condition that allows for a mix of full and partial
 *   expansion of the tree, depending on the depth and a random factor.
 * - The probability of creating a terminal node increases as the depth approaches the minimum height or based on the
 *   ratio of terminal to function nodes.
 * - The tree's height is determined randomly within the specified minimum (`min`) and maximum (`max`) bounds.
 *
 * ## Usage:
 * This method is useful for generating program trees that are not strictly full or balanced, offering a more varied
 * and natural structure. This is particularly beneficial in genetic programming or simulations where diversity in tree
 * structures is desired.
 *
 * ### Example:
 * ```
 * val growingProgram = generateProgramGrowing(
 *     terminals = listOfTerminalNodes,
 *     functions = listOfFunctionNodes,
 *     min = 2,
 *     max = 5
 * )
 * // growingProgram is a randomly generated Program instance with a growing tree structure and height between 2 and 5
 * ```
 *
 * @param terminals A list of `Terminal<T>` nodes to be used in the program tree.
 * @param functions A list of `Fun<T>` nodes to be used as intermediate nodes in the program tree.
 * @param min The minimum height of the program tree to be generated.
 * @param max The maximum height of the program tree to be generated.
 * @param T The type of the values processed by the program nodes.
 * @return A newly generated `Program<T>` instance with a growing tree structure within the specified height
 *   constraints.

/**
 * Generates a [Program] structure with a full tree configuration within specified height constraints, using terminal
 * and function nodes. This function is an extension of the [generateProgram] function, specifically tailored to create
 * full program trees. It is marked as experimental in the Keen library.
 *
 * ## Functionality:
 * - Generates a full `Program` tree, ensuring that every leaf node is at the maximum depth of the tree.
 * - Utilizes the [generateProgram] method, providing it with a condition that ensures the tree is 'full' â€” meaning
 *   each non-leaf node expands until the maximum height is reached.
 * - The tree's height is determined randomly within the specified minimum ([min]) and maximum ([max]) bounds.
 *
 * ## Usage:
 * This method is particularly useful in scenarios where a complete and balanced program tree structure is required,
 * such as in certain types of genetic programming or in algorithmic simulations where full tree exploration is
 * important.
 *
 * ### Example:
 * ```
 * val fullProgram = generateProgramFull(
 *     terminals = listOfTerminalNodes,
 *     functions = listOfFunctionNodes,
 *     min = 2,
 *     max = 5

 * @param max The maximum height of the program tree to be generated.
 * @param T The type of the values processed by the program nodes.
 * @return A newly generated [Program]<[T]> instance with a full tree structure within the specified height constraints.

/**
 * Generates a random `Program` structure with specified height constraints using terminal and function nodes. This

 * computational models such as genetic programming.
 *
 * ## Functionality:
 * - Generates a `Program` tree using lists of terminal ([Terminal]<[T]>) and function ([Fun]<[T]>) nodes.
 * - The height of the generated program is determined randomly within the specified minimum ([min]) and maximum ([max])
 *   bounds.
 * - A [condition] function is used to guide the decision of creating terminal or function nodes at each level.
 * - Utilizes the [Tree.Companion.generate] method to construct the program tree, providing leaf and intermediate
 *   factories for program nodes.
 *
 * ## Usage:
 * This method is particularly useful for generating random program structures in genetic programming, algorithm
 * testing, and simulations where controlled variability in program complexity is required.
